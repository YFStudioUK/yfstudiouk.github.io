            <!-- Challenge -->
            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>The client needed to scale from 10 manually dispatched AGVs to a coordinated fleet of 50 AMRs
                    within their existing 120,000 sq ft facility. Bottlenecks with traffic congestion and
                    inefficient robot coordination were causing missed delivery SLAs during peak periods. Key
                    challenges included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coordinating up to 50 robots in a shared, dynamic space with narrow aisles</li>
                    <li>Preventing deadlocks in single-lane corridors and intersection bottlenecks</li>
                    <li>Optimising battery charging schedules to maintain throughput across 24/7 operations</li>
                    <li>Integrating robots from different vendors (heterogeneous fleet of 3 models)</li>
                    <li>Ensuring low-latency communication for real-time control across the full facility footprint</li>
                    <li>Dynamic task reallocation based on priority and robot status</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What Had Been Tried Before</h3>
                <p>Prior to engaging YF Studio, the client had attempted two approaches. First, they trialled the
                    built-in fleet manager provided by their primary robot vendor, but it could not coordinate the
                    two additional robot models in their fleet and had no deadlock recovery mechanism &mdash; robots
                    would simply stop and wait for manual intervention. Second, they contracted a systems integrator
                    to build a centralised dispatcher, but it treated path planning as a static problem: routes were
                    precomputed at shift start and could not adapt to real-time congestion, leading to cascading
                    delays whenever a single robot deviated from its plan. Both solutions failed to scale beyond
                    approximately 15 robots before congestion became unmanageable.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Solution -->
            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                <h3>1. Centralised Traffic Manager</h3>
                <p>Implemented a global traffic management system using Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms,
                    specifically the Conflict-Based Search (CBS) variant. This system reserves space-time corridors
                    for each robot, guaranteeing collision-free paths and preventing deadlocks.</p>
                <p><strong>Why CBS over alternatives:</strong> We evaluated both Priority-Based Search (PBS) and
                    decentralised ORCA-style velocity obstacles. PBS was faster to compute but produced suboptimal
                    paths in the client's narrow-aisle layout, increasing average travel time by 18%. ORCA could
                    not guarantee deadlock-freedom in single-lane corridors. CBS provided provably optimal,
                    collision-free plans within acceptable compute time (&lt;200ms for 50 robots) when combined with
                    our hierarchical zone decomposition.</p>

                <h3>2. Heterogeneous Fleet Adapter</h3>
                <p>Developed a standardised interface layer using Open-RMF (Robotics Middleware Framework) to allow
                    robots from three different manufacturers to communicate and coordinate within the same system.</p>
                <p><strong>Why Open-RMF over custom middleware:</strong> The client's fleet included robots from
                    three vendors, each with proprietary APIs. Building custom adapters for each would have
                    tripled integration effort and created an ongoing maintenance burden. Open-RMF provided a
                    proven abstraction layer with existing fleet adapter templates, reducing integration time
                    from an estimated 3 months to 6 weeks per vendor.</p>

                <h3>3. Dynamic Task Auctioning</h3>
                <p>Created a market-based task allocation system where robots "bid" on tasks based on their
                    location, battery level, and current capabilities, ensuring optimal resource utilisation.</p>
                <p><strong>Why auction-based over greedy assignment:</strong> The client's previous system used
                    nearest-available assignment, which led to fleet imbalance &mdash; robots near high-demand
                    zones were over-utilised while others sat idle. The auction mechanism naturally distributes
                    load by factoring in battery state, travel distance, and current congestion, yielding 22%
                    better fleet utilisation in our simulation benchmarks compared to greedy dispatch.</p>

                <h3>4. Predictive Maintenance & Charging</h3>
                <p>Integrated a predictive model that monitors battery health and operational patterns to schedule
                    charging and maintenance during low-demand periods, maximising fleet uptime.</p>
                <p><strong>Why predictive over threshold-based charging:</strong> Simple low-battery thresholds
                    caused charging station congestion during shift changes when multiple robots hit the threshold
                    simultaneously. Our predictive model staggers charging across demand troughs, reducing peak
                    charging station occupancy by 40% and eliminating the "charging rush" that previously took
                    up to 8 robots offline simultaneously.</p>

            <!-- Technical Implementation -->
            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <h3>System Architecture</h3>
                <p>The solution is built on a layered architecture:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fleet Level:</strong> Global route planning and task dispatching (Open-RMF)</li>
                    <li><strong>Robot Level:</strong> Local navigation and obstacle avoidance (ROS2 Nav2)</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Level:</strong> Low-latency state synchronization via Zenoh/DDS</li>
                    <li><strong>Interface Level:</strong> WMS integration via REST/gRPC APIs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
                <p>Advanced deadlock prevention strategies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Priority-based Yielding:</strong> Lower priority robots yield to high priority tasks
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Replanning:</strong> Dynamic rerouting around congested areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Traffic Lights:</strong> Virtual traffic control at high-density intersections</li>
                    <li><strong>Buffer Zones:</strong> Dedicated waiting areas for idle robots</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Limitations & Edge Cases</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Maximum Fleet Size:</strong> The system has been tested with up to 50 robots in a
                        single facility. Beyond this, the CBS planner's computation time exceeds the 200ms
                        real-time constraint without further architectural changes (e.g., sharding the planner
                        across multiple zones).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Zone Handoffs:</strong> When robots transition between coordination zones,
                        handoff latency adds approximately 200ms. For time-critical tasks spanning multiple zones,
                        this must be accounted for in path cost estimates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Dependency:</strong> The system requires a dedicated 5 GHz Wi-Fi network.
                        On shared networks, packet loss above 20 robots causes unacceptable command latency spikes
                        (&gt;100ms), leading to precautionary stops and throughput degradation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heterogeneous Speed Limits:</strong> Robots with significantly different maximum
                        speeds (e.g., forklifts vs. shelf-movers) create convoy effects in single-lane corridors.
                        We mitigate this with speed-class-aware routing, but it does not fully eliminate the
                        issue in heavily constrained layouts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manual Intervention Recovery:</strong> If a human manually moves a robot during
                        operation (e.g., during maintenance), the system requires a re-localisation cycle of
                        5&ndash;15 seconds before the robot can rejoin the coordinated fleet.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Operational Metrics (Before / After)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Average robot utilisation: <strong>60% &rarr; 85%</strong></li>
                    <li>Average task completion time: <strong>reduced by 25%</strong> (from 4.2 min to 3.1 min per pick cycle)</li>
                    <li>Main corridor congestion incidents per shift: <strong>12&ndash;15 &rarr; fewer than 1</strong></li>
                    <li>Fleet integration: <strong>single vendor &rarr; 3 robot models</strong> coordinated under one system</li>
                    <li>Deadlock events requiring manual intervention: <strong>~8 per week &rarr; avg. 1 recoverable deadlock per 6 weeks</strong> (auto-resolved within 10 seconds)</li>
                    <li>Scaling from 10 to 50 robots required a Wi-Fi 6 infrastructure upgrade at 30 units to
                        maintain sub-50ms command latency. Above 35 robots, we switched from centralised to
                        hierarchical zone-based coordination to keep the MAPF planner within its real-time
                        compute budget.</li>
